\section{The biomass growth model}
The BGM simulates populations of independently growing yeast cells (\textit{s.cerevisiae}).
As they go through a cycle of cell phases they grow buds and divide when the buds are mature enough.
As a result the number of cells in the population increases significantly over time.
The duration of the cell cycle phases are a subject of intensive study and the precise coordination of cell growth and division remains to be determined.
The BGM aims at illuminating the underlying processes and proposes a possible mechanism.
At its core lies a balance between the cells' capacity to synthesize \textit{cyclins} and their rate of degradation.
In this way cell cycle progression becomes a function of the metabolic capacity of the cell.
Cyclins are certain proteins that are part of a vast signalling network,
which controls the activity of cell phase specific genes sites and regulates the transition from one phase to the next.
These phase transitions are often induced by switch like behavior of the system,
when key cyclins reach a critical level.
Once this threshold is overcome, the genetic program for the next phase is started.
\newline
A greatly simplified model of this regulatory machinery is implemented in the BGM.
It comprises of two dummy cyclins \textit{Cln} and \textit{Clb} and their mRNA.
The cell cycle is divided into four phases (G1, S, G2, M),
the transition from one to another is implemented as an instantaneous event.
The durations of the S and M phase are fixed, 
while the G1 and the G2 phase end when Cln and Clb levels reach a threshold respectively.
Their production is described by a second order reaction kinetic, 
which dependeds on the available mRNA and the metabolic capacity of the cell.
Including a first order degradation kinetic the time derivative of the cyclin concentration $\frac{Cln}{V$} is given as
\begin{equation}
    \frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{Cln}{V}\right) = k_p\cdot mCLN\cdot B_R\frac{A}{V^2} - k_d\cdot \frac{Cln}{V} - n\cdot\frac{\dot V}{V^2}
    \label{eq:Cln_conc}
\end{equation}
Computationally easier is the time derivative of the number of cyclin molecules $Cln$
\begin{equation}
    \dot{Cln} = k_p\cdot mCLN\cdot B_R\frac{A}{V} - k_d\cdot Cln
    \label{eq:Cln}
\end{equation}
$k_p$ and $k_d$ are the production and degradation rate constants, $mCLN$ and $B_R$ the mRNA and the \textit{internal} biomass, $A$ and $V$ the surface and volume of the cell.
The term $B_R\cdot A$ represents the metabolic capacity of the cell.
Spie√üer et al. justified its dependence on the cell surface with the availability of nutrients,
as for an increasing area of the cell membrane the uptake of nutrients should increase as well \cite{Spiesser2012}.
\newline
The mRNA is produced in stochastic bursts, independently of the metabolic capacity.
This makes the duration of the G1 and G2 phase noisy, 
which produces asynchronous cell cultures.
\newline
Similar to the cyclins the total cellular biomass $B$ is produced as a function of the internal biomass and the biomass precursor $mB$.
\begin{equation}
    \dot{B} = k_p\cdot mB\cdot B_R\frac{A}{V} - k_d\cdot B
    \label{eq:BGM_B}
\end{equation}
The biomass itself is divided into biosynthetically active, \textit{internal} biomass and inactive \textit{structural} biomass of which the cell membrane and wall comprise.
The metabolic capacity of the cell is allocated between the two according to the allocation parameters $k_R$ and $k_A$:
\begin{align}
  \dot B_R &= \dot B\cdot \frac{k_R}{k_R + k_A}
  \label{eq:deriv_BR}\\
  \dot B_A &= \dot B\cdot \frac{k_A}{k_R + k_A}
  \label{eq:deriv_BA}
\end{align}
This model for biomass synthesis results in auto catalytic growth, 
which normally leads to exponential growth of the cell.
Because in this case the rate of biosynthesis is scaled with the surface to volume ratio (eq. \ref{eq:BGM_B}) cell growth is more polynomial.
It is slowed down through a feedback created by the proportionality of the structural biomass to the cell surface $B_A \sim A$.
\newline
During the G1 phase the mother grows undisturbed until the amount of $Cln$ reaches the necessary threshold for a cell phase transition. 
Upon entering the S phase the mother stops growing and a bud begins to form. 
Fig. \ref{fig:BGM_twoGen} shows the trajectories of a single cell over two generations.
One can see the Volume of mother and bud, the amount of CLN1/2 and its mRNA and the internal and structural biomass.
After the mitosis the mother and the bud separate and split up the internal biomass and remaining cyclins between them.
\newline
In accordance with experimental observations the BGM predicted a distinct drop of the average G1 phase duration between the very first generation (daughter cells) and the second generation (mother cells).

On the population level the mean cell size converged to a stable value (fig. \ref{fig:BGM_meanV}).
The BGM allows the tuning of the cellular growth rate.
As is observed in experiments (fig. \ref{fig:BGM_meanV}), 
the mean cell size is a function of this rate.
